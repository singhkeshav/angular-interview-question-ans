<summary>What are the key features of Angular?</summary>
<p>Key features include two-way data binding, MVC architecture, dependency injection, directives, and a comprehensive routing system.</p>
<p>Angular, developed and maintained by Google, is a robust platform for building web applications. It offers a comprehensive set of features that support the development, testing, and deployment of complex applications. Here are some of the key features of Angular:</p>

1. Component-Based Architecture
   Angular's architecture revolves around components, which are the building blocks of the application. Each component encapsulates its own logic, template, and styles, promoting modularity and reusability.

2. TypeScript Support
   Angular is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that includes type definitions. TypeScript helps catch errors at compile-time, provides better tooling with autocompletion and refactoring, and improves code maintainability.

3. Dependency Injection (DI)
   Angular's DI framework allows for the efficient management of service dependencies. It makes the code more modular, testable, and maintainable by allowing components to declare dependencies rather than instantiating them.

4. Reactive Programming with RxJS
   Angular incorporates RxJS, a library for reactive programming using observables. This allows developers to handle asynchronous operations and data streams with powerful operators, making it easier to manage complex data flows and state changes.

5. Angular CLI
   The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) streamlines the development process. It provides commands for scaffolding, building, testing, and deploying applications, ensuring adherence to best practices and reducing the setup and configuration burden.

6. Routing
   Angular's built-in router enables navigation between different views or components within a single-page application (SPA). It supports lazy loading, guards, and resolver services, which help manage navigation and data retrieval efficiently.

7. Forms Handling
   Angular offers comprehensive support for both template-driven and reactive forms, including validation and form control. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most suitable approach for their application's needs.

8. HTTP Client
   Angular provides a robust HTTP client for communicating with backend services via XMLHttpRequests or JSONP. It supports features like request and response interception, progress events, and error handling.

9. Animation Support
   Angular includes a module for creating complex animations and transitions using the Angular Animation API. This allows for the enhancement of user experience with smooth and performant animations.

10. Testing
    Angular has built-in support for unit testing and end-to-end (E2E) testing. It integrates with testing frameworks like Jasmine and Karma for unit tests and Protractor for E2E tests, making it easier to write, run, and maintain tests.

11. Internationalization (i18n)
    Angular provides tools for internationalizing and localizing applications. This includes support for translating the UI into different languages, formatting dates and numbers, and handling pluralization rules.

12. Performance Optimizations
    Angular includes various performance optimization features such as Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, which pre-compiles application code during the build process to reduce the amount of work the browser needs to do at runtime. Other features like tree-shaking and lazy loading further enhance performance by minimizing the application size and load times.

13. Angular Universal
    Angular Universal allows for server-side rendering (SSR) of Angular applications. SSR improves the performance of the application, especially for the initial load, and enhances search engine optimization (SEO).

14. Angular Material
    Angular Material is a UI component library that follows Google's Material Design guidelines. It provides pre-built, customizable UI components that help in building consistent and visually appealing user interfaces.

15. Modular Structure
Angular applications are organized into modules, which can be eagerly or lazily loaded. This modular approach improves code management, reuse, and separation of concerns.

     What is a Component in Angular and it's types?
  </p>
  In Angular, a component is a fundamental building block of the application. It encapsulates a piece of the user interface (UI) and its related behavior, allowing for modular and reusable code. Each component in Angular consists of three main parts:

1. Template: Defines the HTML view of the component.
2. Class: Contains the business logic and data of the component.
3. Styles: Defines the CSS styling specific to the component.

Types of Components in Angular.
While all Angular components follow the same basic structure, they can be categorized based on their purpose and usage within the application:

1.  Root Component
2.  Feature Components
3.  Shared Components
4.  Presentation Components
5.  Container Components
6.  Dynamic Components

Let's explore each type in detail:

1.  Root Component
    The root component is the top-level component of an Angular application. It is specified in the bootstrap array of the NgModule decorator in the AppModule (usually app.component.ts).
    <picture>
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    @Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    templateUrl: './app.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
    })
    export class AppComponent {
    title = 'My Angular App';
    }
    </picture>

2.  Feature Components
    Feature components represent a distinct feature or section of the application. They are usually grouped together in a module dedicated to that feature.
    <picture>
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    @Component({
    selector: 'app-dashboard',
    templateUrl: './dashboard.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./dashboard.component.css']
    })
    export class DashboardComponent {
    // Logic for dashboard
    }

            </picture>

    3. Shared Components

       Shared components are reusable components that can be used across multiple feature modules or components. They are typically declared in a shared module.

       <picture>
        import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';
       @Component({
       selector: 'app-button',
       template: `<button>{{label}}</button>`,
       styleUrls: ['./button.component.css']
       })
       export class ButtonComponent {
       @Input() label: string;
       }

       </picture>

    4. Presentation Components

    Presentation components (or dumb components) are focused on how things look. They receive data and callbacks via inputs and outputs and do not contain business logic.
    <picture>
    import { Component, Input, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
selector: 'app-user-profile',
templateUrl: './user-profile.component.html',
styleUrls: ['./user-profile.component.css']
})
export class UserProfileComponent {
@Input() user: any;
@Output() updateUser = new EventEmitter<any>();

onSave() {
this.updateUser.emit(this.user);
}
}

 </picture>
 
 5. Container Components
Container components (or smart components) are responsible for fetching data and managing state. They pass data to presentation components and handle user interactions.

   <picture>
   import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { UserService } from './user.service';

@Component({
selector: 'app-user-container',
template: `<app-user-profile [user]="user" (updateUser)="updateUser($event)"></app-user-profile>`,
})
export class UserContainerComponent implements OnInit {
user: any;

constructor(private userService: UserService) {}

ngOnInit() {
this.userService.getUser().subscribe(user => this.user = user);
}

updateUser(user: any) {
this.userService.updateUser(user).subscribe();
}
}

 </picture>

6.  Dynamic Components
    Dynamic components are components that are created and inserted into the DOM at runtime. They are useful for cases where components need to be loaded based on user interaction or configuration.
    <picture>
    import { Component, ComponentFactoryResolver, ViewChild, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
selector: 'app-dynamic-loader',
template: `<ng-template #container></ng-template>`
})
export class DynamicLoaderComponent {
@ViewChild('container', { read: ViewContainerRef, static: true }) container: ViewContainerRef;

constructor(private componentFactoryResolver: ComponentFactoryResolver) {}

loadComponent(component: any) {
const factory = this.componentFactoryResolver.resolveComponentFactory(component);
this.container.clear();
this.container.createComponent(factory);
}
}
